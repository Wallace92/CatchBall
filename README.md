  Responsie arcade game CatchBall consist of 5 scenes and 22 scripts (over 8000 lines of code). A lot of different assets like vector graphcis created using Inkscape program or music downloaded from freesounds.com. Each script posses some unique feature used in these scenes (loaded or unloaded addtively).
  
<ul>
  <li> <h2> 1. background and menu scenes </h2></li>
  <p>
 These two scenes are loaded in the first order. The background scene loads movable background images (<b>BackgroundDontDestroy.cs</b>)
</p>
  <li>The standar deviation is expressed as:
  
  $$ \sigma = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)}{N} $$

</li>
  <li>The Gauss distribution very well fit many experimental data and determine the probability of occurence each of it</li>
</ul>
Finally the graph is presented using matplotlib library with beatiful latex graphics. The straight line at the middle shows the mean value of approximated data.
